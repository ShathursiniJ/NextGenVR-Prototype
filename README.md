## 📌 Design Guidelines

### 🖼 Layout

* Designed for VR headset displays
* 3D perspective guides and spacing optimized
* Grids reflect immersive depth interaction

### 🎨 Colors & Typography

* Primary palette: Neon / Dark contrast
* Typography follows consistent hierarchy:
  **Headers → Body → Captions**

### 📐 Interaction

* Prototype uses Figma Smart Animate & Interaction triggers
* Click/hover states defined for simulation output

---

## 📌 Handoff Notes for Developers

* All layout elements are exported and named consistently
* Color & text token definitions available in Styles panel
* Interaction flow diagrams exist in “Prototype Flow”

If exporting assets:

* Select components → Export
* Use **SVG/PNG** depending on use case
* All elements are organized in groups

---

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

* Add full VR environment mockups
* Integrate sound interaction cues
* Add user onboarding with tutorial walkthrough
* Build clickable interactions for 3D prototypes
